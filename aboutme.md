title: About me
---

My name is Nick Ramskill. I'm a UK transplant to California. Passionate about technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. 

My undergraduate and graduate degrees are in Chemical Engineering. As a graduate student my research was focused on the fluid mechanics of multipase flow in porous materials such as geological rocks (oil recovery) and catalysts (reaction engineering). 

Since moving to California, I now work at Taylor Farms as a Process Engineer focused on process automation and industrial robotics. 

Over the last few years my interest in programming has grown as I have learned more about the huge opportunities and potential that Machine Learning and AI have for solving technological challenges. Specifically, my interests are in image processing and machine vision.

For me, the goal of this blog is to document my journey towards learning about these topics and to build a portfolio of interesting projects I tackle on the way. 

Also likely to be used as an outpost for other things that pique my interest.
