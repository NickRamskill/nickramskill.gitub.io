title: Logistic Regression Mini-Project (Part 2)
subtitle: Multiclass Logistic Regression Classification
---

One of the areas of machine learning and AI that I find to be the most interesting is in computer vision. Specifically, applications that I find to be incredibly exciting at the moment are in robotic vision systems and in geospatial analysis. Therefore, the application of machine learning to perform object recognition from images is an area that I am eager to learn more about. 

So, in the second part of the mini-project, I have implemented the multiclass logistic regression classification algorithm both from scratch and using the scikit-learn toolbox. This has been used to predict numerical values between 0 and 9 from an image of a handwritten digit from the MNIST dataset. A sample of the images from the MNIST dataset are shown below.

Here is a [link](https://github.com/nickramskill/Machine-Learning-Projects){:target="_blank"} to the Jupyter notebook detailing the model development and testing. 

Using my home-built algorithm I obtain a prediction accuracy of 89 % whilst using the scikit-learn implementation an accuracy of 91 % has been obtained. The objective of this exercise was not to draw a comparison between the accuracy of the two algorithms but rather to learn how to implement the multiclass logistic regression classification model and to familiarize myself with implementing machine learning models using scikit-learn.
