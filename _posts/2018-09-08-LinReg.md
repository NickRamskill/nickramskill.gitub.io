title: Linear Regression Mini-Project
subtitle: Predicting the Quality of Wine using Machine Learning
---

In the first couple of weeks of the Coursera Machine Learning course, the focus was on linear regression and its application to the univariate and multivariate versions of the algorithms. In the two assignments, the goal was to use linear regression to predict (i) the profit of a new branch of a company based on the population of the city and (ii) the value of houses based on their associated features, such as number of rooms and square footage of the lot. 

After completing the lectures and assignments, I implemented the linear regression algorithm in Python and applied it to a mini-project on predicting the quality of wine based on a series of measured physicochemical properties of the wine. 

Instead of utilising scikit-learn to implement the model (as I will probably tend to do for future models), I decided to go the route of programming all of the steps (i.e. scaling the features, calculating the cost function and gradient descent) from scratch to ensure that I fully understood the translation from the theory to the practical application.  

Here is a [link](https://github.com/nickramskill/nickramskill.github.io/blob/master/_posts/MultivariateLinReg.ipynb){:target="_blank"} to the Jupyter notebook detailing the model development and testing. The data for the project was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
