The overarching goal of this blog is to document my learning about Machine Learning and AI. The purpose of this first posting is to outline my strategy with regards to HOW I am going to achieve this. 

As with most that are conducting personal study into Machine Learning - the obvious place to begin is with the immensely popular Andrew Ng MOOC on Coursera. I'm going to be no different in this and use this as my roadmap and syllabus for the first phase of this journey.  

In parallel, I will be reading around the subject-matter in greater detail and taking notes to ensure I fully understand the underpinning mathematics and theory behind each of the algorithms implemented in the course. 

Additionally, for each of the topics covered I will apply the new skills I learn to an interesting and relevant problem. 

So to summarise - my approach over the coming months will be:

1. Follow Andrew Ng Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera (lectures and assignments)
2. Reading up on the mathematics and theory behind the algorithms
3. Apply learning from 1. and 2. to an interesting and relevant mini-project

After following this approach for the eleven weeks of the Andrew Ng MOOC, I should have a good foundation in place to begin tackling more challenging projects. 

Looking forward to it. 

Just as a side-note - I will be working on the Andrew Ng course assignments in Matlab and my personal projects in Python.
